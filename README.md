The goal of Blackjack is to get a hand with a higher total value than the dealer, while not going over 21.   
When the dealer or player goes over 21, the hand becomes what is known in Blackjack parlance as “busting” - which always results in a loss of the round.

Kards:  
Ace: Either the value 1 or 11. You decide which of these values ​​the card has.  
Faced cards: All face cards are worth 10  
Other cards: All other cards are worth their numerical value (a 3 is worth 3, a 5 is worth 5, etc.).  

Dealing of Cards:   
Players and Dealer are each dealt 2 cards. Players' cards are face up. The Dealer has one face up card and one face down card.  
Player's Choice: Before the dealer reveals his face down card, players can choose to take another card ore stand.  
Dealer's Choice: The dealer reveals the hole card and takes another card until the hand has a value of at least 17,(or take cards until over player in value, or are bursting) and then the game ends.

Vinning:  
To win a Blackjack hand, you need to have a hand with a total value closer to 21 than the dealer.
